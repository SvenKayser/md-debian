# md-debian
Debian build system for Orange Pi and other Allwinner H3 boards (will support more in the future if i get my hands on them. donations/testers welcome.)

I am planning to set up a repo for shipping kernel updates and custom applications (not anything major, just chip-specific stuff, like for changing resolution, etc.)

The build script is tested on Debian Stretch, and its the only supported platform for now, but it should work on anything with minor modifications (replace "CC" with any triplet your system uses.)
